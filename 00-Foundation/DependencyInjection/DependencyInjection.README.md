# Design Patterns in .NET

## 📌 Overview

This repository is a **practical and structured guide to Design Patterns**,
with a strong focus on **.NET / C# backend development**.

The goal is not just to explain patterns theoretically,
but to **understand the problems they solve**, see **wrong vs correct implementations**,
and apply them in a **realistic .NET context**.

---

## 🧠 What are Design Patterns?

Design Patterns are **proven solutions to recurring software design problems**.
They help you write code that is:

- More maintainable
- More flexible
- Easier to test
- Easier to extend without breaking existing code

Design Patterns are **not frameworks** and **not libraries** —
they are **ways of thinking and structuring code**.
