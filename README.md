# Design Patterns – .NET Practical Examples

This repository contains **practical implementations of common Design Patterns in .NET (C#)**.

The goal is not to showcase patterns by name,
but to demonstrate **when and why** each pattern is used through real examples.

Each pattern includes its own detailed README with explanations and code examples.

## Repository Structure

### 00 – Foundation

Core patterns and concepts commonly used across applications.

- **DependencyInjection**
  Managing dependencies and reducing tight coupling.

- **UnitOfWork**
  Coordinating multiple repository operations as a single transaction.

---

### Behavioral Patterns

Patterns focused on **object communication and behavior**.

- **ChainOfResponsibility**
- **Command**
- **Mediator**
- **Observer**
- **Specification**
- **State**
- **Strategy**
- **Template Method**

---

### Creational Patterns

Patterns focused on **object creation mechanisms**.

- **Factory**
- **Singleton**

---

### Structural Patterns

Patterns focused on **object composition and structure**.

- **Adapter**
- **Bridge**
- **Composite**
- **Decorator**
- **Facade**
- **Flyweight**
- **Repository**

## What You’ll Find Inside Each Pattern

Each pattern project demonstrates:

- A real design problem
- A naïve or problematic implementation
- A cleaner and more maintainable solution
- Clear use cases and explanations (inside each pattern README)

---

## Tech Stack

- Language: **C#**
- Platform: **.NET**
- Focus: Clean Code, Maintainability, and Design Thinking

---

## Notes

- Design Patterns are not rules
- Not every problem needs a pattern
- Simpler solutions are often better

Patterns are just names —
**good design thinking is what actually matters.**
